how many points out of 10 do you deserve on this assignment: 10

## Self-Reflection:
Overall, this assignment wasn't too bad. Mostly, I had trouble with the eslint config file, since although there were some resources available to help migrate to the new file format from the one used in the instructions, they weren't nearly detailed enough to configure lint for jest or cypress. It took me a good half hour before I finally figured out how to set up eslint using the new config file, and I gave up when I got to configuring it for cypress. It would've been useful to use the old JSON format instead, but I couldn't figure out how to run eslint using it, so that was a no-go. Other than that, though, it was smooth sailing. I have a bit of experience with Jest and Cypress, so it wasn't too hard writing up those tests. Overall, everything seems to be working as intended, so I think this assignment is worth full points.

### How long it took me to finish this?
About 2 hours
